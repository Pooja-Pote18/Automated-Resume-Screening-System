# Automated-Resume-Screening-System


This project is an **Automatic Resume Analysis Tool** that helps HR teams, recruiters, and students analyze resumes.  
It extracts text from resumes (`PDF` & `DOCX`), preprocesses using **NLP**, compares against a given Job Description (JD),  
and generates an **ATS Score (%)** for ranking candidates.

✅ Features:
- Extracts text from resumes (`.pdf`, `.docx`)
- Cleans & preprocesses text (stopwords removal, lemmatization)
- Extracts keywords using **NLTK**
- Calculates **ATS Score (%)** based on JD matching
- Ranks candidates & exports results to `CSV`
